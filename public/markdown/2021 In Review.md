I just finished creating this blog, and it came with two big challenges. The first one was trying to figure out how to actually
create a blog system from scratch. I was asking questions like:

- What language(s) do I use?
- How do I store "articles"?
- Where will it be hosted?

Ironically, answering these questions was easy. What was harder was actually figuring out what the first article
should be about. I have no shortage of ideas for blog posts, including topics such as productivity, technology, woodworking and DIY. However,
going into any one of those specific topics right off the bat just felt a bit... awkward. I thought about it for a while, and decided that the new year
was a perfect opportunity to look back at 2021 and take inventory of what I've accomplished. This provides me the opportunity to touch on all of those
topics that interest me in bits and pieces. 2021 was a crazy year for all of us, so let's jump right in.

# We bought a house!

![(The only photo I had on hand was from Halloween)](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/house_halloween.jpeg)

The first major event of last year was buying a house, which itself is something that I could probably write dozens of posts about. In December 2020,
my wife and I had been engaged for a few months and decided that we were ready to upgrade from apartment living. We were fortunate
enough to be in a situation where we had a good bit of time to find a home that fit our needs perfectly. We were especially
fortunate to find a home that we fell in love with in less than a month, so the process didn't get dragged out. Little
did we know that the real estate market would absolutely explode just a couple of months later.
\
\
The process of searching for a home was one of the most exciting and stressful things I've been through. I'll spare you the details,
but at the end of the day we were able to close on our home by the end of January 2021. Since then, it's been non-stop work renovating
the inside, improving the yard, and plenty of other small projects here and there. While there are definitely pros and
cons to home-ownership, and these vary given anyone's personal situation, for us it has been one of the best decisions we've made.
We love having the extra space, and the ability to make it our own.

# We got married!

![The newlyweds](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/wedding.jpeg)

In April, we sealed the deal and got married! We had a perfect wedding and everything went off without a hitch. I'll walk you through the day piece by piece, at
least from my own perspective. First off, I got maybe 3 hours of sleep the night before. I am amazed that I was able to get through such a long day on so
little sleep. Adrenaline rush, man! The weather forecast predicted a 100% chance of rain for almost the whole day. We assumed that would force us indoors, but hey, they say rain on your
wedding day is good luck, right?
\
\
After consuming enough caffeine to kill a small bear, the groomsmen, the dads, and I met up for breakfast. We then got dressed to the nines and went
on the venue to hang out for a bit. We had a couple drinks before the ceremony and just shot the breeze, which helped ease the nerves a bit. My
wife and I did a first look to have our own moment before the ceremony, which was a great experience. Since it was meant to be just for us, all I'll say about it is that
I'm really glad we did it. I'd highly recommend it to any other couple getting married.

Sure enough, about 30 minutes or so before the ceremony, the sun came out, and the rain disappeared. You'd never even think it had rained that day
by the time we got started! Since our venue's biggest attraction was the outdoor decor and gardens, we really enjoyed being able
to take advantage of some good weather. I like to joke that we got the best of both worlds - rain on the wedding day, but sunshine for
the ceremony. As if the wedding itself wasn't already a blast, let me tell ya - the honeymoon was easily the best vacation I've ever
had. We went to Key Largo and spent a week sipping on Mai Tais in an oceanfront pool. Can't beat that!

# Our first child - it's not a human

![Our goodest boy, Atlas](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/atlas.jpg)

This little guy has had such a huge impact on our lives in a way we never could have expected. Of course everyone says that dog is man's best friend,
but he's more like an equal family member to us. Some time in June, for absolutely no reason, I came inside from doing some work in the yard and told
Sam "I think we should go look at dogs and get one." While I was fully committed to getting one, I had no idea that within 24 hours my wife
would come back to me with dozens of dog listings from different shelters near us.
\
\
We looked at all the dogs on these different shelter websites and picked a few to go look at one afternoon. We went to a shelter near us called
Furkids and looked at 4 dogs, Atlas being the first. He set the bar extremely high with both his intelligence and his capacity for
emotional connection. Within just a few minutes of meeting him, it was like we already had a connection with him. He would stare
at us straight in the eyes like he was communicating with us, and followed us all around the little pen we were in - just like he does
now at home. Seriously, you cannot get this dog to stay put. He follows us EVERYWHERE! According to my wife, she knew we were getting him as soon
as she saw his picture and read his bio. The rest of the looking we did was just a formality!
\
\
We did a DNA test and found out that he's about half Pitbull and half everything else - Great Pyrenese, Border Collie,
Boxer, Redbone Coonhound, and the list goes on. If there's any dog that's a testament to the idea that Pitbulls
are not aggressive dogs, Atlas is the one. He's just about the sweetest dog I've ever met, and all he ever wants to do is play and cuddle.

# If you give a man a table saw...

![My new table saw!](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/table_saw.jpg)

For my birthday in July, my wife got me something I'd been wanting for some time that we finally had the space for - a table saw! To
be economical, both financially and space-wise, I got a job-site DeWalt table saw. I think people seriously underestimate these little
saws though, as I've been able to do some pretty precise work using it. Really the only drawbacks I've found are the lower horsepower and the
smaller, plastic table. When you compare this to something like a big cabinet saw however, I can live with those two things if it means literally saving
thousands of dollars.
\
\
Getting a table saw opened up so many creative avenues for me. Originally, I envisioned mostly using it for home repair or small DIY projects, but
as it turns out, I really enjoy woodworking. Since getting the table saw, I've spent an almost embarrassing amount of money on other tools, materials,
lumber and more. It's become one of my favorite hobbies, and building tangible things you can put use and put your hands
on has been a nice contrast to my professional passion of building software.

![First shop cabinet I built](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/drill_station.jpg)

Most of my time in the shop so far has been spent working on shop projects. In my opinion, this is a great way to dive into woodworking
since you can get away with using cheaper materials (for example, I mostly use Radiata Pine plywood). You can live with small inaccuracies and mistakes working on these projects.
I've gotten a lot of practice this way building cabinets, shelves and more. Now when the time comes to build a bathroom vanity or some kitchen cabinets, I'll know what I'm doing!

![Power tool cabinet](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/power_tool_cabinet.jpg)

My shop right now is mostly built around a French cleat system, using strips of wood cut with a 45-degree notch so that custom hangers can be made with opposing angles. This
is great, especially since I'm still figuring things out, as it keeps my shop reconfigurable and functional.

# Reprogramming

![Some random guy programming](https://devdaniel-io-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/img/coding.jpeg)

If there's any negative consequence of such a fun, busy year like this one, it's that I radically shifted my focus away from coding. In the 5 or 6 years before this one, I would spend more than 12 hours a day
programming. Of course, I still write code nearly every day for my full-time job, and like most programmers I still learn and tinker plenty. However, outside of work, coding definitely took a back seat for a solid 6 months, and
in mid-to-late 2021, I consciously decided to invest more time into it.
\
\
I started off by enrolling in a 5-week-long coding bootcamp at T-Mobile, where I currently work. I'll be honest, I had pretty low expectations considering I've
already got close to 5 years of experience under my belt. I was thinking this would be more useful for entry-level engineers. However, plenty of people from my
team had gone through it and said it was beneficial, even for more senior engineers, so I kept an open mind and gave it a shot. While I honestly wouldn't say I gained a ton of
programming knowledge, it definitely re-sparked some of that interest and passion I have for coding. It was great fun building little projects using almost any language or tool we wished.
For example, I've always had a passion for JavaScript, and it was a great excuse to hone my skills with tools like Angular and React. We also learned some pretty useful tools I hadn't used before,
such as Cypress, an automated end-to-end testing framework for the front end.
\
\
The momentum from this bootcamp kept me interested in learning and led me to start following a ton of programming and software subreddits on Reddit. I felt that aggregating
information from many smaller, more diverse communities like this was a great way to gain a holistic perspective on software development. For example, I
followed subreddits for:

- Go
- React
- Angular
- Spring
- Clojure
- And many more!

Following these led me to hear more and more about a JavaScript framework called "Svelte", which is bleeding-edge and still very new. The idea behind Svelte, as far as I can tell
in my limited experience playing with it, is to try to simplify the front-end web development experience. One strategy for this is reducing the visible "magic" you see in some other frameworks,
such as JSX in React or the plethora of special HTML attributes in Angular (my favorite JS framework). Svelte on the other hand feels much more like vanilla web development - in a single `.svelte` file,
you have a `<script>` tag, a `<style>` tag, and your markup. There's still a little templating syntax to learn, but the learning curve for this framework is definitely shallower than the two aforementioned.
\
\
This made me want to build something in Svelte. Through more learning and research, I found SvelteKit, and decided I would rebuild my personal website with it. However, after a few days of working with it,
I decided that SvelteKit is simply just not ready for production applications. To be fair, it's still in Alpha at the time of me writing this. While I still definitely want to invest time into Svelte and
learn more, I pivoted and decided to use React, since I hadn't really touched it for a year or so. I'm amazed at the strides and changes that React has made, moving away from
class components and adding other features like hooks and context to name just a few. I'll have a separate post later on about how I built this site with React, but for now just know
that I love the "new React".

# Looking forward to 2022

In 2022, I actually plan to do a lot more of the same. First and foremost, this blog is something I've wanted to do for a long time, and I put a ton of effort into building it to
fit my exact needs. So expect many new articles and functional improvements to the blog. Secondly, I feel that 2022 will be a great year for striking balance in all the things
I love to spend time on. These include quality time with my wife, playing with the puppy, woodworking, and especially programming. Finally, I'm sure we can all agree that hopefully 2022 will see
the COVID craziness die down a little, so we can continue getting back to normal life!
\

Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great 2022 as well.

## Other small, fun things

- I bought a new electronic drum set, which has been a game changer combined with moving into a
  house. I'm a night owl, and there's just something about playing drums at 2am.
- Woodworking provides the ability to not just make things you want, but also things you need. Our dog used to hate the basement
  because it was boring, but he loves looking out the window. I built a raised bed platform for him, so he can sit up high and
  look out the windows to the backyard. Now he feels like the king of the basement. He loves it down here now!
- I plan to write a much more in-depth article about these things, but to anyone who wants to be more productive,
  I recommend Googling the following keywords (separately): "Todoist", "Notion", "Atomic Habits", "Tim Ferriss",
  and "Pomodoro". These have all been almost life-changing for me.
- For the first time in my life, I've started actively playing and learning chess, which has been made so accessible via [Chess.com](https://chess.com). I've found this to be a great way
  to stay sharp, train yourself to look for patterns and tactics, and is definitely a fun at-home activity during the pandemic.
